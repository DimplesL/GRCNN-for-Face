# GRCNN-for-Face
Gated Recurrent Convolution Neural network for Face Recognition with Combined Angular Loss
This project is an application of GRCNN for OCR. For details, please refer to the paper: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6637-gated-recurrent-convolution-neural-network-for-ocr.pdf

The network architecture uses GRCNN and we implements a combined angular margin softmax loss function for face recognition.
